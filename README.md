M-Pesa STK Push Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate Safaricom‚Äôs M-Pesa STK Push API using Node.js and Express. It allows you to initiate payment requests to a mobile number via M-Pesa and handle callback responses for transaction status.


---

üîë Prerequisites

1. Safaricom Developer Account
Sign up here to access the M-Pesa API.


2. App Registration

Log in to the Safaricom Developer Portal.

Navigate to My Apps and create a new app.

Select the MPesa Sandbox APIs for your app and copy your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.



3. Callback URL

You need a publicly accessible Callback URL to receive transaction updates.

For testing, you can use a deployment platform like Heroku or expose your local server using ngrok.


Examples:

Deployed URL (Heroku):
https://example.herokuapp.com/mpesa/callback

Localhost (ngrok):
Run ngrok http 3000 and use the generated link:
https://<random_string>.ngrok.io/mpesa/callback
